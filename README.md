# 5 Day Weather Forecast Dashboard by Server API
Using the [Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) to retrieve weather data for cities, I have build a 5 Day Weather Forecast Dashboard. This Weather dashboard will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. It'll use localStorage to store any persistent data.
